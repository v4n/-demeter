# Notes

A couple things that would be great for a more accurate production level app:

- Env variables (e.g. the Graphql url)
- Add module alias so we can do `@utils/constants` instead of `../../utils/constants`  when importing
- Styles variables (color, font weight, font size)
- Clean up ants container e.g. logic like sorting can be moved out to service/utility
